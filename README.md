# "The Wave" Web Browser for C64/C128 GEOS Wheels

Now you can enjoy graphical web browsing on your Commodore 64 or Commodore 128. "[The Wave](http://web.archive.org/web/20090609065620/http://cmdrkey.com/cbm/wave/wave.html)" makes this all possible. ([Alternate binary download](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/geos/comm/index.html))

*NOTE: The Wave requires a Commodore 64 or 128 running Wheels (GEOS upgrade) with a SuperCPU and at least 4 MB of SuperRAM memory.*

Included in this archive are all the source code files needed to recreate The Wave 64 V1.0 and The Wave 128 V1.0.
